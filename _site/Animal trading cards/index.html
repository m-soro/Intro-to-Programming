                with its diving speed of 200mph. They are three times faster than a cheetah, 
                the fastest animal in the land!

			<p> Peregrine Falcons are common along the coast. 
                They their kill prey by severing the spinal column at the neck. 
                They have been used in falconry for 3,000 years due to their speed
                and are used to scare other birds to prevent bird-plane strikes 
                improving air traffic safety.
